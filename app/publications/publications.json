Through an iterative usability study, involving 48 children (8-10 years old), and a mix-method approach to triangulate findings, the research evaluates the system's effectiveness in (i) user-system interaction; (ii) guiding users' movements for IPS; and (iii) overall satisfaction. This iterative design process unveiled insights into synchronization mechanics, informing the development of more sophisticated and enriched interactive experiences. The findings suggest a promising trajectory for assessing the potential impact of IPS on prosocial behavior in the future. Moreover, the study anticipates future exploration of DragonIce's benefits in creating a supportive social environment, particularly for children facing difficulties in \u2026"

For years this was explained by accounts that considered the male gender more compatible with the autistic phenotype. However, new research suggests that a lack of understanding and recognition of the female autistic phenotype, and a predisposition to associate males with autistic traits, could lead to structural inequalities that hinder the identification of autistic females. To explore how autism and gender are more widely perceived, the present study tested implicit and explicit associations between autism and binary gender using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Autism Quotient (AQ) presented alongside a male or female vignette. A significant association was found on the IAT, identifying an implicit bias towards males and autistic traits. The vignette AQ pairing also revealed some specific items perceived as explicitly male traits, while only reverse-scored items were perceived as female. These findings suggest that current perceptions and even metrics of autism are skewed towards males, which may hinder the identification and understanding of the female autistic phenotype."

The objective of the Art and Game project (AGAP) was to draft recommendations on the structure and content of workshops for elderly people with neurocognitive disorders and healthy seniors, with a particular focus on remote/hybrid workshops, in which at least a part of the participants is connected remotely. Recommendations were gathered using a Delphi methodology. The expert panel (N = 18) included experts in the health, art and/or board games domains. They answered questions via two rounds of web-surveys, and then discussed the results in a plenary meeting. Some of the questions were also shared with the general public (N = 101). Both the experts and the general public suggested that organizing workshops in a hybrid format (some face-to-face sessions, some virtual session) is feasible and interesting for people with neurocognitive disorders. We reported guidelines on the overall structure of workshops, practical tips on how to organize remote workshops, and a SWOT analysis of the use of remote/hybrid workshops. The guidelines may be employed by clinicians to decide, based on their needs and constraints, what interventions and what kind of workshop format to employ, as well as by researcher to standardize procedures to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatments for people with neurocognitive disorders."

Imagined coordination led to greater levels of deindividuation and affiliation. That is, participants were less likely to report seeing themselves as unique individuals, instead viewing themselves as a part of a group (deindividuation) and more likely to report a sense of emotional closeness (affiliation) with the imagined group. Deindividuation partially mediated the effect of imagined coordination on affiliation.

Two hundred and nine participants told two lies and two truths and then completed a self-report scale that elicited their experiences when deceiving. A factor analysis of responses produced four factors, three of which were strategic in nature: Nonverbal behaviour control, which relates to attempts to monitor and control nonverbal behaviour when lying; Detail, which relates to attempts to produce detailed, engaging lies; Cognitive difficulty, which relates to the cognitive difficulties experienced when lying and their strategic consequences; and Anxiety, which relates to the negative emotions experienced when deceiving. The results further our understanding of the psychological processes that underpin deception and suggest several potentially fruitful avenues for \u2026"

Across two studies, people who had previously performed coordinated movements were over three times more likely to give their time to help their co-actor when asked 24 hours later than those who had performed a similar but uncoordinated task. Findings showed that group-level categorisation, but not social affiliation, partially mediated helping behaviour. This provides preliminary evidence that the pro-social effects of coordination are sustainable over a longer period than previously reported, and that the effects of coordination upon pro-social motivation may be more related to changes in group level categorisations than increased social affiliations."

This work reviews all of the social effects of entrainment and the various explanations for them. The group formation framework emerges as a parsimonious account claiming that as we entrain our sense of self is temporarily diluted as an interdependent identity becomes more salient, thus leading to a range of social and psychological consequences which are pro-group. The sense of belonging arising from moving together is conducive towards pro-social behaviours; yet, it also makes the individual more susceptible to adopting the ideology of the group without critical thinking. We argue that the wide landscape of interpersonal entrainment\u2019s effects reflects its primary effect, de-individuation, and the formation of a common group identity amongst co-actors."

Social contact interventions have been shown to reduce prejudice and stereotyping, but optimal contact conditions between groups are often out of reach in day to day life. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a synchronous walking intervention, a non-verbal embodied approach to intergroup contact that may reduce the need for optimal contact conditions. We studied attitude change towards the Roma group in Hungary following actual and imagined walking, both in a coordinated and uncoordinated manner. Results showed that coordinated walking, both imagined and in vivo, led to explicit and implicit reductions in prejudice and stereotyping towards both the Roma individual and the wider Roma social group. This suggests that coordinated movement could be a valuable addition to current approaches towards prejudice reduction."

Participants performed significantly better on the animal version of the assessment compared to the human version, and human rather than animal scores were the strongest predictor of symptom severity.

This review examines the literature concerning ToM and anthropomorphism in relation to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), specifically addressing the questions of how and why those on the spectrum both show an increased interest for anthropomorphism and may even show improved ToM abilities when judging the mental states of anthropomorphic characters. This review highlights that while individuals with ASD traditionally show deficits on a wide range of ToM tests, such as recognizing facial emotions, such ToM deficits may be ameliorated if the stimuli presented is cartoon or animal-like rather than in human form. Individuals with ASD show a greater interest in anthropomorphic characters and process the features of these characters using methods typically reserved for human stimuli. Personal accounts of individuals with ASD also suggest they may identify more closely with animals than other humans. It is shown how the social motivations hypothesized to underlie the anthropomorphizing of non-human targets may lead those on the spectrum to seek social connections and therefore gain ToM experience and expertise amongst unlikely sources."

This begs the question, how stripped down can a coordination task be and still affect pro-sociality? Would it be sufficient simply to imagine coordinating with others? Imagining a social interaction can lead to many of the same effects as actual interaction . We report the first experiments to explore whether imagined coordination affects pro-sociality similarly to actual coordination. Across two experiments and over 450 participants, mentally simulated coordination is shown to promote some, but not all, of the pro-social consequences of actual coordination.

        "abstract": "Adults in the general population have been shown to struggle with social perspective taking, also known as theory of mind (ToM). Research has struggled to identify aspects of cognition that explain ToM development in adult populations. One promising area of study relates to the discovery that personality traits have considerable explanatory power in regard to cognitive ability, as presumably a person\u2019s preferences affect their subsequent skill development. In order to better understand adult ToM variance, an investigation of personality traits and their relation to ToM ability was conducted. In an effort to find an appropriate model, traits related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a disorder characterized by ToM deficits, were explored. This study analyzed responses of 359 participants drawn from a university sample using an online assessment platform. Participants\u2019 ToM was tested using the Faux Pas Recognition Test (FPT), and ASD related traits were identified using the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). All traits were entered in a linear regression to determine which were predictive of ToM performance. Two traits, Communication and Imagination, were found to be significantly predictive of ToM ability in the general population. The literature suggests that both traits underlie ToM at multiple points in development. The ToM difficulties in the general population are significantly related to challenges understanding communicative intent, as well as problems simulating lived experiences of others. Future research could focus on exploring the role of personal self-efficacy in communication and imagination during ToM development, and the relation \u2026"

        "abstract": "Although it is well established that rhythmically coordinating with a social partner can increase cooperation, it is as yet unclear when and why intentional coordination has such effects. We distinguish three dimensions along which explanations might vary. First, pro-social effects might require in-phase synchrony or simply coordination. Second, the effects of rhythmic movements on cooperation might be direct or mediated by an intervening variable. Third, the pro-social effects might occur in proportion to the quality of the coordination, or occur once some threshold amount of coordination has occurred. We report an experiment and two follow-ups which sought to identify which classes of models are required to account for the positive effects of coordinated rhythmic movement on cooperation. Across the studies, we found evidence (1) that coordination, and not just synchrony, can have pro-social consequences (so long as the social nature of the task is perceived), (2) that the effects of intentional coordination are direct, not mediated, and (3) that the degree of the coordination did not predict the degree of cooperation. The fact of inter-personal coordination (moving together in time and in a social context) is all that's required for pro-social effects. We suggest that future research should use the kind of carefully controllable experimental task used here to continue to develop explanations for when and why coordination affects pro-social behaviors."

        "abstract": "Seventeen adolescent students from The Monarch School of Neurological Differences with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were tested for mentalizing deficits often found in individuals with ASD using the theory of mind (ToM) battery (Baron-Cohen, 1985). Test results revealed that twelve of the seventeen students were found to have a more advanced ToM than original research suggested. These qualifying students were administered the Strange Stories Test (Happ\u00e9, 1994), a series of short vignettes in which characters must interpret contradictory statements. During Strange Stories testing, students were asked to provide explanations for their answer choices. This semi-structured interview was designed to clarify specific theories surrounding ToM acquisition as well as to uncover similarities in the experiences students have had related to mentalization. All interviews were recorded and transcribed, and two researchers applied a system of consensual qualitative coding which yielded an interrater reliability of 1.0. The primary researcher determined five overarching themes yielded post-coding. Results are explained in the context of current mentalizing theories, and implications for future research are additionally discussed."
